remote_pkg cookbook
============
This cookbook has provider. It is the pkg provider (remote_pkg).  This provider is compatible with Mac and will install a package from a http server. 

Requirements
------------
### Platform
- Mac OS X

Resources/Providers
-------------------
### pkg

This resource will install a Osx Pkg. It will retrieve the PKG from a remote URL. The PKG file will be stored in the `Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]` and deleted after the install unless you set `cleanup` to false. If you want to install a PKG that has already been downloaded (set `remote` parameter to false), copy it to the appropriate location. You can find out what directory this is with the following command on the node to run chef:

```bash
knife exec -E 'p Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]' -c /etc/chef/client.rb
```

#### Actions
- :install - Installs the application.

#### Parameter attributes:
- `app` - This is the name of the app that the pkg will be installing.
- `checksum` - sha256 checksum of the pkg to download.
- `cleanup` - Specify whether or not we should keep the downloaded pkg.
- `pkg_name` - Specify the name of the pkg if it is not the same as `app`-`version`, or if the name has spaces. Don't include .pkg.
- `receipt` - Receipt registered with pkgutil when a pkg is installed.
- `remote` - Specify whether or not we should attmpt to download the pkg.
- `version` - string of version number.

#### Examples
Install `osquery` from the primary download site. This will download a file called `osqueryd-1.1.0.pkg`.

```ruby
remote_pkg 'osqueryd' do
  version '1.1.0'
  checksum '3701fbdc8096756fab077387536535b237e010c45147ea631f7df43e3e4904e0'
